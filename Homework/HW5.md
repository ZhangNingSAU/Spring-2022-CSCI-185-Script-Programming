# Step 1: Please use the correct Unix commands to complete the following eight tasks in your terminal:

## Q1. Create a new directory called csci185_hw5 in your home directory.

Note: your home directory is the working directory you have when you open your terminal, not the **/home** folder in Linux.

## Q2. Copy the states.txt file from the csci185_hw4 to csci185_hw5

## Q3. Please create a short name (topfive) to display the first 5 lines of states.txt

+ **Note**, use alias command to create a temporary short name, you do not need to add it to the ~/.bash_profile(MAC) or ~/.bashrc(linux), but you can try to use vi to edit it.

## Q4. Please create a short name (tailfive) to display the last 5 lines of states.txt

## Q5. Please run your alias command topfive to create top-five.txt.

## Q6. Please run your alias command tailfive to create tail-five.txt.



## Q7. Please use diff to display the difference of the topfive.txt and tailfive.txt.

## Q8. In the first 6 lines of states.txt, which of them contain a letter "k"?
+ Hint: Use **head**, **pipeline**(|), and **grep/egrep**.
