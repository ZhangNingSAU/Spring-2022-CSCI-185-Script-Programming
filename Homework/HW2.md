# CSCI 185 Spring 2022
# Homework 2

# Due: 11:59pm Wednesday 02/09/2022

# Step 1: Please use the correct Unix commands to complete the following five tasks in your terminal:

## Q1. Create a new directory called csci185_hw2 in your home directory.

Note: your home directory is the working directory you have when you open your terminal, not the **/home** folder in Linux.

## Q2. Create a file called numbers.txt in csci185_hw2.

## Q3. Append the numbers 1, 2, and 3 to numbers.txt so that each number appears on itâ€™s own line.

## Q4. Print numbers.txt to the command line.

## Q5. Use output redirection to create a new file in the csci185_hw2 directory called list.txt which lists the files and folders in your home directory.

Note: list the files and fodlers in your home directory, not in csci185_hw2 folder.

(Hint: **ls** lists all the files and folders in the current working directory, **output redirection >** redirects the output of a command to a file)

# Step 2: Please screen shot your terminal with the above five tasks
# Step 3: Please save the 5 screenshots in a PDF file, name it as "CSCI185_Homework2_JohnDoe(0123456).pdf", where 0123456 is your BeeCard number, and sumbit it on [Blackboard](https://blackboard.sau.edu/)
