+ The tool we’ll be using the most in this book is a shell, which is a computer program that provides a command line interface.
  - The shell is a very direct and powerful way to manipulate a computer.
  - There are several popular shell programs but in this book we’ll be using a shell called Bash because it’s the default shell program on Mac and Ubuntu.
+ [Linux Statistics](https://hostingtribunal.com/blog/linux-statistics/#gref)
  - Windows claims 82.56% of the world’s OS market.
  - 1.63% of all desktop operating systems worldwide ran on Linux.
  - In 2019, 100% of the world’s supercomputers run on Linux.
  - Out of the top 25 websites in the world, only 2 aren’t using Linux.
  - 96.3% of the world’s top 1 million servers run on Linux.
  - 90% of all cloud infrastructure operates on Linux and practically all the best cloud hosts use it.
## Getting Unix
### Mac & Ubuntu Users
+ If you’re using a Mac or you’re using the Ubuntu operating system find a program called Terminal and open it. You can skip the next section about Windows.
+ Note that you may need to change the default shell to bash if it is not (For Mac, check [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/444596/how-to-change-the-default-shell-to-bash-in-macos-catalina/)).
### Windows 10
If you’re using the latest version of Windows 10 you should enable and install Bash on Ubuntu on Windows. You can find the installation guide from Microsoft [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10?redirectedfrom=MSDN)
